      <p>
        A blockchain is a distributed, append-only database hardened against
        tampering and revision that provides a single shared source of
        cryptographically verified truth. This ensures that your company will
        always work, even if a government or malicious third party tries to
        tamper with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Ethereum, code is immutable and everything is explicitly encoded. It
        is not up to random interpretation.
