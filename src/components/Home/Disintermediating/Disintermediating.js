          Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and
          maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain
          technology. We want to empower people across the world to easily and
          securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone
          to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take
          control of their own lives
        </p>
        <p>
          By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are
          enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of
          value
